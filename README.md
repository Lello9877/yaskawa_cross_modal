# yaskawa_cross_modal

ROS 1 package used for a cross-modal learning approach to shape reconstruction of the cables explotiting different perception modalities on board the Yaskawa Motoman SIA5F. The approach is based on a visuo-tactile method by using an Intel RealSense D435i and a SUNTouch tactile sensor.

## Installation

You need all the pkgs listed in `my.repos`.
You can download all the repos using `vcstool`:
```bash
# In the src of your catkin worksapce
vcs import < ~/yaskawa_cross_modal/my.repos
```

## Setup

To configure your enviroment for the RealSense, follow the installation guide at https://github.com/IntelRealSense/realsense-ros/tree/ros1-legacy.
To configure your enviroment for the SUNTouch, follow the setup guide at https://github.com/marcocostanzo/tactile_sensor_ros.


## Run the ROS drivers

You can visualize the experimental setup by using the launch file:
```bash
roslaunch yaskawa_cross_modal display.launch
```

You can run the driver to read the debiased voltages by using the launch file:
```bash
roslaunch yaskawa_cross_modal tactile.launch
```

You can run the driver to visualize the point cloud generated by the camera using the launch file:
```bash
roslaunch realsense2_camera rs_camera.launch
```

The robot nodes and the services can be run by using the launch files:
```bash
roslaunch yaskawa_cross_modal bringup_server.launch
roslaunch sun_yaskawa_nodes bringup_motoman.launch
```

To bring up the ROS network:
```bash
roslaunch yaskawa_cross_modal bringup_network.launch
```

To start the reconstruction:
```bash
rosrun yaskawa_cross_modal task
```
